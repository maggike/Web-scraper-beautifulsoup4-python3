# Web-scraper-beautifulsoup4-python3
The Python script uses the beautiful soup 4 Python library to interact with the HTML content of a website helping us extract the content we desire. In this case, it was the prices of the products!
To run the script, make sure you are in the directory which contains the script and run the command ```python web_scraping.py```

You should see the following prompt:


```"What product would you like to search for?"```


Input the name of the product just as you would in newegg.com and click enter.
You should see a list of products, with their title, price and link to the product which can be copy-pasted into your browser to get to the cheapest product available on newegg.com, matching the product you entered in your prompt.


Have fun exploring cheap products!!
